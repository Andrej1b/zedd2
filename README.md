## Usage üî•

Press the button `IMPORT` and select `ALL` in the dropdown to import Clarity accounts. This needs to be repeated when new accounts are added to Clarity that you want to book on. Usually, importing a single project is enough.

Enter what you are currently working on in the field `Currently Timing`. This does not necessarily have to be a Clarity account.
If JIRA is configured, tickets from Jira will be suggested.

Enter the Clarity account for the task in `Clarity-Account for Task ...`. This can also be done later/Friday and is retroactive.

Optionally, add a comment in `Clarity-Account Comment for This Task`. The tag is automatically calculated and entered in Clarity beforehand.

At the bottom, you can see what will be exported to Clarity. What is currently displayed will always be exported. The
`Autosubmit` checkbox next to the `Clarity` button will submit the timesheets as well.
